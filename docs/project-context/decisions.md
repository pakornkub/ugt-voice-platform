- 2026-09-02 Migrate the whole app from Vite+React SPA+Express (Google AI Studio scaffold)
  to Next.js App Router — **because** the org's `ugt-nextjs-*` install pipeline (SQL Server
  via Prisma, Keycloak SSO/RBAC, Jenkins/SonarQube CI, shared design system) only targets
  Next.js App Router, and the user wants this deployable under the org standard while
  keeping the exact same design/UX/workflow · rejected: adapting the `ugt-nextjs-*` skill
  assets to a non-Next.js stack (the skill explicitly forbids this — assets are org-standard
  contracts, not templates to bend).
- 2026-09-02 Phase A of the migration is a pure framework port with **zero data-layer
  changes** — every component keeps using `localStorage`/`sql.js` exactly as before, the
  free role-switcher dropdown stays, the SQL Query Studio stays — **because** this keeps the
  highest-risk step (framework port) independently verifiable as pixel-identical to the
  original before layering in the real DB/auth rewrites · rejected: doing the data-layer
  rewrite and framework port in the same pass (harder to verify, harder to roll back a
  regression to just one cause).
- 2026-09-02 Both Mail and Upload optional modules are wanted for the eventual org rollout
  — **because** the app's notifications (gatekeeper/CEO alerts, SLA warnings) are currently
  in-app only and attachments are currently a fake `Math.random()` simulator; both need real
  infra (SMTP relay, ClamAV) to be genuinely useful in production · deferred to their own
  chunks (`ugt-nextjs-mail-setup`, `ugt-nextjs-upload-setup`), not built in Phase A.
- 2026-09-02 Auth will be **SSO (Keycloak) only**, which retires the free role-switcher
  dropdown once implemented — **because** the org standard for this kind of app is SSO, and
  the user accepted that a free role switcher is inherently incompatible with real RBAC ·
  rejected: keeping the switcher alongside real auth (defeats the purpose of access control).
- 2026-09-02 `ExportAnalyticsModal`'s "SQL Query Studio" (arbitrary user-typed SQL against
  the in-browser sql.js copy) will become a set of **preset reports** once wired to real SQL
  Server — **because** letting arbitrary end-user SQL reach a real production database is a
  security risk the org standard won't accept · rejected: keeping raw SQL access scoped to
  admin + a read-only DB user (still considered a live risk, and preset reports cover the
  same "export for analysis" need without it) · rejected: dropping the feature entirely (the
  user wants the export/analytics capability preserved, just not as raw SQL).
- 2026-09-02 `tickets` moves from a natural key (`tracking_code` as PK, per the
  `src/services/sqliteDb.ts` draft) to a **surrogate `id` (cuid) + `@unique trackingCode`
  column** in `prisma/schema.prisma` — **because** the org naming/audit-column convention
  (`ugt-nextjs-database-setup`'s `references/naming-conventions.md`) requires a surrogate PK
  named `Id` on every app-owned table, and this was already flagged as needed in the Phase A
  handoff notes · rejected: keeping `trackingCode` as PK (violates the org convention, and
  ties every FK in the schema to a human-editable-looking string instead of an opaque id).
- 2026-09-02 The app's own per-role tab/permission settings table (`RolePermissionConfig` in
  `src/types.ts`) maps to **`RoleAccessConfigs`**, not `RolePermissions` — **because**
  `ugt-nextjs-auth-setup` will later install its own singular `RolePermission` table for
  Better Auth's core RBAC, and the two are structurally different things (this app's table is
  tab-visibility/capability settings for 4 fixed roles; Better Auth's is the real
  session-backed permission model) · rejected: naming it `RolePermissions` (the more obvious
  plural) — would collide/confuse with the future Better Auth table sharing nearly the same
  name.
- 2026-09-02 `lib/prisma.ts`/`lib/env.ts`/`lib/actions/` live at the **repo root**, matching
  `ugt-nextjs-database-setup`'s literal asset destinations and its `verify.mjs`'s hardcoded
  paths, reached from `src/` code via a new `@/lib/*` -> `./lib/*` tsconfig path listed ahead
  of the existing `@/*` -> `./src/*` rule from the Phase A migration — **because** keeping the
  skill's assets at their documented location keeps `verify.mjs` and future `/plugin update`
  kit-syncs accurate without needing a project-specific carve-out · rejected: moving them to
  `src/lib/` to match the rest of the codebase (would need `.claude/rules/ugt-nextjs-database.md`
  edited every time it's overwritten wholesale by the skill, and made `verify.mjs`'s hardcoded
  `lib/prisma.ts`/`lib/env.ts` checks permanently red).
- 2026-09-02 SQL Server host/instance, port, database name, and login credentials are all
  **placeholders** in `.env.example`/`.env.local` for this chunk — **because** no real SQL
  Server was available to provision against yet, and the user (coordinator) explicitly chose
  to proceed with placeholders now rather than block the chunk on Admin/DBA turnaround ·
  the full schema, offline-generated initial migration, and seed script are built exactly as
  if the connection were real, so going live is `npx prisma migrate resolve --applied
  20260902000000_init && npx prisma generate && npx prisma db seed` once real values land
  (tracked in `docs/admin-handoff.md` and `.claude/state/handoff.md`) · rejected: leaving the
  database chunk entirely undone until real infra exists (would block every later chunk that
  depends on the schema being in place, e.g. auth's session tables referencing app data).
- 2026-09-02 Every table's `CreatedBy`/`UpdatedBy` audit columns are **nullable** for now
  (org convention normally requires `CreatedBy` on master/transaction tables) — **because**
  there is no real authentication yet, so no session user id exists to stamp · deferred:
  tighten to required (or default to a system actor) once `ugt-nextjs-auth-setup` lands and
  every Server Action in `src/lib/actions/` can receive a real user id.
