# Model Mode

<!-- Owned by /ugt-model-mode — switch with `/ugt-model-mode easy|default|god|auto`, never edit by hand. -->

Current mode: **default**

When dispatching a subagent or spawning a teammate (superpowers pipeline,
Agent tool, or Agent Teams), pass `model:` by task type:

| Task type                                | Model  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Plan / analyze / understand requirements | fable  |
| Write code (feature work)                | sonnet |
| Review code                              | fable  |
| Diagnose a bug (root cause unknown)      | fable  |
| Fix a bug (root cause known)             | sonnet |
| Run tests / verify scripts (mechanical)  | haiku  |
| Docs / light edits                       | haiku  |

- **This table wins over model advice inside any skill** — including the
  "Model Selection" section of `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`:
  this file enters context through the CLAUDE.md import, and CLAUDE.md-level
  instructions take precedence over skill text.
- superpowers role → task type: brainstorming / writing-plans research →
  Plan · SDD implementer → Write code (or Fix a bug when the root cause is
  known) · SDD spec reviewer + code reviewer → Review code ·
  systematic-debugging → Diagnose · running verify/test scripts → mechanical.
- Dispatched work only — the main session model is the user's `/model`; never switch it.
- Task type not listed → omit `model:` (the subagent inherits the session model).
