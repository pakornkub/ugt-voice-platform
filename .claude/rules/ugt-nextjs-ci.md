# CI/CD rules (loads when touching Jenkinsfile / Docker / Sonar config)

This project: no basePath (standalone deploy), no Sentry, Prisma/SQL Server
present — see `docs/project-context/decisions.md` (2026-09-02,
`ugt-nextjs-cicd-setup`) for why. Storage (`/app/storage`) and ClamAV
(`clamav` service) are wired into both compose files already — see
`.claude/rules/ugt-nextjs-upload.md`.

## The stage list is the contract — change commands inside stages, never remove stages

```
Checkout → Install → Code Quality (parallel: lint / format:check / typecheck)
  → Unit Tests (JUnit + coverage) → Build
  → OWASP Dependency Check (90-min timeout + suppression file)
  → SonarQube Analysis → Quality Gate (abortPipeline: true)
  → Docker Build → Deploy        ← last 2 stages only on main/develop
post: emailext (success/unstable/failure/aborted) + cleanWs
```

## Quality Gate (measured on new code)

| Condition                        | Threshold |
| -------------------------------- | --------- |
| `new_violations`                 | = 0       |
| `new_duplicated_lines_density`   | ≤ 3%      |
| `new_coverage`                   | ≥ 60%     |
| `new_security_hotspots_reviewed` | = 100%    |

Always `waitForQualityGate abortPipeline: true` + a timeout — without
`abortPipeline` the gate goes red while the pipeline stays green, which is
worse than no gate because it manufactures false confidence.

## Secrets

- Secrets in `sh` must be expanded by the **shell**: `"$VAR"` — **never** Groovy
  interpolation `"${VAR}"`, which leaks the value into the build log (watch out
  especially inside `sh """..."""` where Groovy interpolates every `${}`)
- Temp files holding secrets are deleted in `post { always }`
- `NOTIFY_EMAIL` / `SMTP_FROM` are Jenkins Global env vars — never hardcode
- Credential naming: `nvd` · `env-ugt-voice-platform` · `env-ugt-voice-platform-dev`
  (no `sentry-dsn-*` — this project has no Sentry)

## Branch / per-branch values

`main` = prod · `develop` = dev (everything suffixed `-dev`)

Branch-dependent values **must** be resolved inside `script {}` from
`env.BRANCH_NAME ?: env.GIT_BRANCH?.tokenize('/')?.last()` — never in the
global `environment {}` block (global = one value for every branch).

## Docker

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is inlined into the bundle at compile time → pass it as
  **`--build-arg`** only; setting it in compose `environment:` does nothing
- Deploy with `--no-build` (reuse the image from the Docker Build stage) —
  letting compose rebuild drops the build args and ships a broken bundle
- Tag images with `BUILD_NUMBER`, not bare `latest` (no rollback otherwise)
- Healthchecks hit `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost` (Alpine resolves it to IPv6 and fails)
- `pull_policy: never` in compose — the image is built locally, not in a registry
- **Migrate before `compose up`, always** — migrate fail = no deploy
- `next.config.ts` sets `output: process.env.CI ? 'standalone' : undefined` or
  the Dockerfile's `COPY .next/standalone` fails
- The `app` service `depends_on: clamav: condition: service_healthy` — compose
  will not start `app` until `clamav` reports healthy (its `start_period: 300s`
  covers the ~1 GB first-boot signature download)

## SonarQube config

- `sonar.sources`/`sonar.tests` = `src/app,src/components,src/services,lib` —
  this project's real layout (no root `app`/`components`/`hooks`, see
  `docs/project-context/architecture.md`). Every path **must exist** — a
  missing path fails sonar-scanner instantly
- `sonar.javascript.lcov.reportPaths=coverage/lcov.info` — without that file
  `new_coverage` reads 0% and the gate blocks with no error pointing at the cause
- Every entry in `sonar.cpd.exclusions` / `sonar.issue.ignore.multicriteria`
  and every `<suppress>` in `owasp-suppressions.xml` needs a **comment/`<notes>`
  explaining why**, and may only be added after reviewing a real finding —
  never suppress preemptively

## CI env

`CI=true` + `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` — **`SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION` is for build/CI
only; never set it in the production container** (it would skip runtime env
validation).

## Health endpoint

`src/app/api/health/route.ts` predates this chunk (added by
`ugt-nextjs-upload-setup` with `aiAvailable`/`scanAvailable`) — this chunk
extended it in place with a real DB check (`checks.database`, 200/503) instead
of replacing it with the skill's generic asset, to keep the existing fields.
`status` is `'healthy'`/`'degraded'` (org-wide contract literal — do not
rename it) and the route never includes version/commit info. Until real
`DATABASE_URL` values land (see `docs/admin-handoff.md` §1), this endpoint
returns 503 and the Deploy stage's health poll will not succeed — expected,
not a bug (the `prisma migrate deploy` step earlier in Deploy already fails
first for the same reason).
